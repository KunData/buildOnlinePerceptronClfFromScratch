#### This project aims to build an efficient and accurate Online Perceptron Classifier in Python from scratch for text classification under a real-world scenario: efficiently train the classifier with one million restaurant reviews and ratings, then make highly accurate prediction on 320,122 test examples to find out whether or not the ratings of restaurants are at least 4 out of 5 stars based on customers' reviews. To handle the challenges brought by the 1,000,000 Ã— 6,680,976-dimensional training feature matrix, the original Online Perceptron implementation is further improved with two different approaches: one is the Mini-Batch Stochastic Gradient Descent which speeds up the time-consuming training process by batch-based matrix operations and much less iterations, the other is the Chi-square feature selection preprocessing which significantly reduces the features from 1,000,000 to 101,040. Test error rates obtained from these two enhanced Online Perceptron classifiers are 9.48% and 9.75%, respectively, both beat the benchmark error rate of 10.06%. As for the training time, both methods only need about 6 ~ 7 minutes, which is 35 times faster than the original classifier. ####

#### Besides computational efficiency and classification accuracy, the Mini-Batch online classifier also shows a very high model interpretability, its final weight vector provides a good feature importance measure: weights with large absolute values correspond to very positive or negative comments, which naturally implies a +1 or -1 class label from the perspective of speech analysis. ####
